      I gather user, business, and functional requirements, then translate them
      into software requirements that our developers can use and more
      importantly, understand. I create iterative design mockups and interactive
      prototypes for design exploration, user testing, and communicating design
      specifications. I also help plan, scope, and implement our development
      sprints, maintain a tidy Jira board, and make sure we are tracking against
      our development goals.
